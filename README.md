üß† Smart Task Planner

Smart Task Planner is an AI-powered project and study task planner that generates meaningful, step-by-step task plans based on your goal. It can create a daily timeline with task descriptions and dependencies, using either local logic or an LLM (via OpenRouter API) for more intelligent planning.

Features

Generate a structured plan for any goal (study, project, exam, interview preparation, etc.).

Supports LLM-based reasoning for generating meaningful task descriptions.

Fallback local logic ensures a plan is always generated even without an API key.

Includes:

Task titles and descriptions

Start and end dates

Dependencies between tasks

Lightweight and easy-to-deploy FastAPI backend.

Clean, simple frontend design for interacting with the planner.

How It Works

Enter your goal (e.g., ‚ÄúPrepare for GATE exam in 3 days‚Äù).

The system determines the total duration from your input.

The LLM generates a daily task plan with meaningful steps.

If API fails, fallback local reasoning generates a basic plan.

The output includes tasks with:

Title

Description

Duration

Start/End Dates

Dependencies

Installation & Usage

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-task-planner.git
cd smart-task-planner/backend


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set OpenRouter API key (optional, for better reasoning):

export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"  # Linux/macOS
setx OPENROUTER_API_KEY "YOUR_KEY_HERE"     # Windows


Run the backend:

uvicorn main:app --reload


Open the frontend index.html in your browser and generate plans.
